# Chaseing Game with Shortest Path Algorithm
Welcome to our chasing game project! This project was developed as part of our Fundamentals of Computing II course by a team of three members. The game features a playable main character and two enemies that chase the character using a shortest path algorithm, along with power ups and weapons used in the game, implemented with C++ and the Qt framework.
